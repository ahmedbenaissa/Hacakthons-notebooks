# Hacakthons-notebooks
### In this repository you can find the notebooks of some of the AI Hackathons I've been part of as a team or individually. Each notebook contains a description of that Hackathon and the solution provided.
### keep in mind these notebooks are rushed as they are in the context of a 24h hackathon
